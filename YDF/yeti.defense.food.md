I have been many things in my life, but for the vast majority of it I spent in
various capacities as an internet technician/engineer/technical manager of some
sort. I also tend to avoid normal work schedules and the politics an rigamaroll
what goes with them. So I worked overnights, weekends, holidays and kept the
world spinning while the daywalkers enjoyed hour-long commutes in stop and go
traffic, hovering micromanagement, all the fun stuff that goes with the 
territory. When I got married, my wife was not nearly as big a fan of the 
rolling schedule that I had grown accustomed to duing my bachelor days. I was
working(midnight - noon Sat, midnight - noon Sun, midnight - 0800 Mon on job 1
and 0900-1700 Mon-Fri on job 2. So I trimmed back the hours to 3 days a week on
job 2 and flopped to 1600 - midnight Fri, noon - midnight Sat, noon - midnight
Sun at job 1. This put me on what was known as 4th shift. 

After a couple of  years on 4th shift, my co-manager at the time took a 
different position and one of the network admins was promoted. She and I worked
in the same cubicle and had a pretty good run. Sitting back-to-back with her in 
less than 8 foot of desk space led to some frustration at times, but we got 
through it and have remained good friends to this day. The origins of Yeti
Defense Food (YDF) tracks back to one of these frustration episodes.
There are many quirks about me that become irritating after a while, but the 
ones that are key here are

- I am allergic to macadmia nuts. As this was an adult onset allergy, there is
a significant likelihood that I could develop an allergy to other nut protiens
at any time. So I avoid all nuts and go a bit crazy when they are around me if
I have not slept in a couple days.
- I easily latch onto phrases/words that are rhythmic/humorous and repeat them
unconsciously. 
- I have a habit of doing way too much research into anything that catches my
fancy. For example, I once spent nearly 8 hours one day researching exterior
doors, their inserts, pricing, construction, folks around town that made them.
I have never owned a home.

While working a particularly rough weekend, I wanted something crunchy, salty,
nutty. Well as that wasn't really a possibility I got to looking at alternative
foods. I remembered that we used to make pumpkin seeds when I was a kid and 
they tasted a lot like peanuts in the shell. But I am not a fan of the shell 
portion of the ordeal as they tended to be difficult to remove and often broke
up as you tried to eat them, or if you choose to eat the whole thing, you end 
up chewing shards of angry paper long after you are done with the pumpkin seeds
Well I learned that you can buy shelled pumpin seeds, I went to the local food
store and bought some raw, shelled pumpkin seeds. 

While I was snacking on them, I started doing some research on their uses, 
cultivation, traditions, all sorts of stuff. During this research, I learned 
that these were used _a lot_ in Latin American cuisine. They were used in rice,
stews, as a thickener alternative in some molè recipes; and the had a better
name for them than pumpkin seeds.

Pepitas. Try it, pepitas. Just rolls off the tongue and makes you chuckle a
bit, pepitas. I bet you can see where this is heading. . . the next few weeks
were torture for my co-manager, Several times per shift she would let me know
that I was muttering pepitas. After one of these barrages, she told me to knock
it off and I looked at her and said, 'Little known fact, yeti *LOVE* pepitas!'
This broke us severely and for the rest of that shift there would be random
laugter at this ridiculousness.

Over the next few months, I kept a pretty steady supply of pepitas to snack on.
The place that had the best price on them was the local international market. 
One run to the market I decided to pick up some eccles cakes (If you don't
know, you better ask somebody!). As I sat out in front of the store enjoying my
pastry and a can of milk coffee (Mr. Brown's), I decided to pop a handful of 
seeds. MY HEAD ASPLODE!! This was one of the the best flavor profiles that I 
had ever had.

The next time that I was in the market, I was picking up the pepitas, which was
kept in a small section in the produces department housing the nuts, seeds, and
dried fruits in deli containers. I was looking around the dried fruits to see 
if there was something for my granola experiment I was working on and they had
black currants, the primary ingredient in eccles cakes. I grabbed a pack and 
the original was born.

These are several iterations of the same sort of theme. Pumpkin seeds and dried
fruit. Some I am a huge fan of others not so much. Some were created for a 
special set of circumstances, some becuase I found a name I wanted to use and
designed a thematically appropriate YDF around it.

### The Methods

The methods I use in the preparation of YDF are meant to be as simple as I can
make them. You never know when you will need to mix a batch, them yeti are 
crafty and if you are stuck out on a trail for an extended period, It might be
a good thing to be able to make some up with just a few tools. if push comes to
shove you can eyeball things and hope for the best, but this is how I do it.

#### Measuring

In the recipes, I use part measurments. At the tail of the recipe you will see 
a couple of lines that look like this:

    1 part == <mass>
    E: ### | F: ## | C: ## | P: ###
    
    Na: ### | K:  ### | Zn:  ### | Ca: #### | Fe: ### 
    Mg: ### | Ma: ###
    
    A: ### | B6: ### | B12: ### | C: ### | D: #### | E: ###
    K: ####

The base 'serving size' which I use to list the nutritional value is for a 
single part. If for example I give a part size of 28g, that means  in a recipe
calling for 1 part of ingredients A and B, and 2 parts of ingredient C, the 
total weight of that serving would be:

    28g + 28g + 2(28g) 
    112g

This is to save on having to do division from the final product. The sole 
exception to this is any spices that are added. Because the amount of spice is
so miniscule compared to weight of other ingredients, they will be given 
separately. 

Directly below the the part size, you will find the macronutrients and total
energy provided. Energy is listed in kCals and each of the macros are listed in
grams. Below that is listed any significant mineral content provided by the
listing. Finally, we will toss in any vitamin compounds included.

#### Dicing

If I do anything to the fruit, I will dice it into very 1/8" (2-3mm) cubes, 
this allows them to mix well with the seeds and provide a more uniform flavor
profile. If I am in a rush, I will just toss them in as is and deal with it.

#### Mixing

The vast majority of these are assembled by simply dumping the components into
a vessle and mixing. I prefer to not make a large amount in advance, but if you
do I strongly suggest that you keep the seeds separate from the fruit. The 
moisture from the fruit will tend to be pulled into seeds causing a mushy mix
the longer they are in contact with each other. 

There are a few recipes in here that use a sunflower butter base, These should
be mixed up about 12-24 hours in advance of consumption and allowed to firm up.

Finally, the muesili and granola preparations. 

- Preheat the oven to 350°F. 
- Grease and line a sheet pan with parchment.
- Combine the grains in a heat-proof bowl.
- Heat the oil in a pan over med-low heat until it is liquid. 
- Add the spices, cook until you can smell the spices, count to 3. 
- Add the sweetenener and let it heat through until it flows like water. 
- Pour the oil and and sweetener concoction over the grains.
- Stir until the liquid is absorbed by the grains.
- Spread the grain mixture on the sheet pan.
- Bake for 15 minutes.
- While you are waiting for the grains to toast, measure and mix your seeds.
- At 15 minutes pull the sheet pan and mix in your seeds.
- Return the granola to the oven for another 10-30 minutes stirring every
10 until it reaches a golden brown color.
- Remove from the oven and mix in fruits, be sure to mound the mixture in small
clusters.
- Let it cool completely before you break it up.

#### Nixtamalization

I was torn about whether or not to put this in here. Strictly speaking, it 
isn't really a part of YDF; however, I mention hominy in the corn section and I
guess there are few enough guides out there for how the process works that one
more won't be too oppressive:

- Weigh out your corn. add it to a pot that is at least 3-4 times larger than
the volume of corn. Make sure the pot is __*NON-REACTIVE*__!
- Weigh 1% of your corn's weight in cal. (1g of cal for every 100g of corn)
- Make a slurry out of the cal.
- Pour the slurry over the corn.
- Add water to the pot to cover the corn by 2-3 inches.
- Bring to a boil.
- Reduce heat and continue to cook until the skins have loosened and the kernel
is toothsome but not crunchy when bitten. I rinse my kernels extensively prior
to testing them. I am not sure if this is needed, but not a big fan of chemical
burns so I figure the 30 second rinse is worth the time.
- Let the corn sit in the alkali solution for 8-12 hours.
- Rinse the hominy, (it's not corn anymore). Take off about 1/2 - 3/4 of the 
skins. 

After nixtamalization, the corn will be ~1.5 - 2 times the size and the 
chemical make up has transformed to release a large amount of nutrients.

### The Ingredients

#### Seeds

I use hulled, raw pumpkin seeds unless otherwise noted. Later on I might get
into the production, harvest and hulling of these, as I want to be able to 
create my own supply and test out the flavor differences between varieties of
pumpkins. But for now, I use bulk, allergen free suppliers on the internet, of
which there are too many to mention here. I use raw pumpkin seeds because they
have a sweeter nuttiness that is a lot like pistachios. When they are toasted
they tend to be a bit more like peanuts or soybeans, so if that is your thing,
enjoy, but, I would suggest trying them raw first to see how it hits you.

Most other seeds that I use (sunflower, sesame, flax) will be roasted before
use. This adds a depth of flavor and contrasts with the creaminess of the
pepitas and the sweet and tart fruits. 

#### Dried Fruit

I prefer non-sulfured, organic, unsweetened fruit for my mixes. These tend to
have a better flavor in my opinion and mix better with the seeds. The biggest
exception to this is cranberries. I find unsweetened dried cranberries tough to
put down, in this case I look for ones that use apple or grape juice as a 
sweetener. The organic, unsweetened fruits will be a bit more costly than their
conventional counterparts, but I look for smaller, sustainable outfits that can
supply me to avoid a lot of the mass economy chain. If possible, locally grown,
bought in season and dried at home is ideal, but not really needed. as many
responsible growers and drehydration specialists provide allergen free product.

Many of the recipes do not specify a particular fruit. They will simply call 
for a mixture of sweet or sour fruit.

##### Sweet Fruit:
- Black Currant
- Raisins or Zante Currant
- Prunes
- Peaches
- Apples
- Pears
- Apricots
- Blueberries
- Strawberries
- Pineapple

##### Sour Fruit:
- Cranberries
- Tart Cherries
- Pineapple

#### Cacao Nibs

These are a bit dicey and a good bit expensive. The flavor profile is somewhere
between a dry red wine and very dark chocolate. They tend to have a drying 
effect on the mouth. The style i get are already crushed into uniform pieces
just smaller than GrapeNuts™. They contain a touch of caffeine and good bit of
fat. No matter how well they are picked over, I seem to always get a couple of
bits of the husk included with the nibs. This is similar to getting a touch of
an egg or nut shell in the middle of your dish, so if that puts you off you
might want to try dusting in cocoa powder instead. 

Cocao powder is the solids after the butter has been leeched out. The process
significantly reduces the fat and calories. Raw cacao nibs are approximately
42% fat where raw cocoa powder is 14%. In order to replace this, ideally, you
would add in the amount of cocoa butter, but other pure fats would also work. I
would mention that melting point of cocoa butter is around 100°F, so ghee, 
coconut oil, or any oils liquid at room temperature will alter the composition.
The best application for this approach is in the bars or granola applications 
where there is a medium that can suspend the cocoa and additonal fats. 

So if the recipe calls for 28g of nibs, this would include put us at around 12 
grams of that being fat. Now with the application of a little bit of algebra we
get the following equations:

    .14p + b = 12 
      -- Percentage of fat in the powder, multiplied by the weight of the powder
         added to the wight of the butter should equal amount of fat in the nibs
    
    p + b = 28
      -- The weight of the cocoa powder and the weight of the cocoa butter
         should equal the total weight of the nibs

This allows us to calulate the amount of added fat we need to balance out what
is lost by using cocoa powder instead of the crushed nibs. Now we just need to
solve the system of euations:

    b = 12 - .14p         -- Butter weight = nib fat - the fat left in powder

    (12 - .14p) + p = 28  -- Butter weight + powder weight = nib weight
    12 + .86p = 28        -- Remove powder fats from the powder weight
    .86p = 28 - 12        -- Remove nib fat from the nib weight
    .86p = 16
    p = 16/.86            -- Solve for powder weight
    p = 18.60
    
    18.60 + b = 28        -- Insert powder weight into the simpler equation
    b = 28 - 18.60        -- Solve for butter weight
    b = 9.4

If you want to want to keep the same nutrition but use cocoa powder in this
instance, you would need to add 18.6g or so of cocoa powder and 9.4 or so of 
cocoa butter. This is likely only of interest to folks that are needing to make
sure that they are hitting specific caloric goals and densities and are using
these for longterm preperations (long distance backpacking trips or dietary
concerns), but as I happen to fall into one of those categories and had to do
the math anyway, I figured I would share in case others needed it struggle with
equation setups as much as I do.

#### Grains

__Oats__:

I use old fashioned rolled oats in my preparations. This provides the most 
consistent results. Quick cook oatmeal (not instant) can also be used in this
method, but keep a very close eye on it when toasting they are rolled much
thinner than old fashioned oats and will burn very quickly. If I have to use 
quick oats I normally run on medium-low heats and it will take between 1/3 to
1/2 the time of old fashioned oats. At this time, I have not tried whole oats,
though that is on tap for this winter. I typically omit any sort of grains from
late spring until the weather drops into the 70s, which allows me to use the 
stove as little as possible. 

The most common way I will add oats is to make up a granola (see method above).
I also will do a psuedo granolo with them some times in the winter if I don't 
want to eat granola for a week at a time. To start, heat up some oil, usually 
coconut, in a small pan (mine is a 1.5qt saucepan from target) over medium-high
heat. Next, add some spices and wait until things smell amazing. Toss in the 
oats and start stirring or shaking the pan. The oats will start to smell nutty
and change to golden in color, Pull them off, the heat will continue to cook 
them and if you wait until they look toated, they will burn before they can
cool.

__Corn__:

This is going to be using dent corn, not sweet corn. This is the hard stuff 
that is ground down to make corn meal, grits, and cornstarch. It is not hard to
come by online, or if you have farmer's market in your area. Ask around someone
will likely be able to point you in the right direction. I use this for a few
reasons. First, it is easier to store long term. Once you crack a grain, its 
shelf life drops dramatically and oxidation begins immediately. Second, it
affords some peace of mind. I am not a fan of GMO stuffs, and the farms that I
buy from are using heirloom varietals that haven't been tinkered with so much.
Third, it tastes better. Different corn species taste different and behave 
differently when processed.

Hominy is nixtamalized corn, you can get it in a can in most grocery stores,
dried (pazole) in reasonably stocked grocery stores or international markets, 
or make it yourself. This stuff is amazing and tasty. It is what makes corn
tortillas, tameles, fritos, and corn nuts (reasonable substitute for fried 
hominy). 

Grits/corn meal/polenta is ground corn. I prefer to use hominy grits as they 
are beter tasting and more nutritious, but they have become rather hard to find
if you don't want to make your own.

Parched corn/popped corn are the same thing depending on the variety of corn 
you use. If you are using a high moisture, flint hulled corn, it will build up
enough pressure to rapidly expand and gelatinize the starches making the 
glorious movie snack we all love. If you do the same thing with a variety that
is either lower in moisture or has a thinner skin (most dent corn falls into 
this category), It will still gelatinize, but with less velocity so you end up
with a denser cruchier product. This will be akin to the mostly popped kernels
at the bottom of the bucket.

### The Recipes

#### Ol' Grand Dad

This is the grandaddy of 'em all. It is still one of my favorite flavor 
combinations and is dead simple to make. If you cannot find black currants, any
raisin or zante current is ok.  No, on second thought, they aren't ok. They 
take away the beautiful sparkle provided by black currants. There are some
later varieties that make these work.
